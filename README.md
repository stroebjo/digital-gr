# digital:gr

digital-gr is small tool to help training verb declinations of ancient greek verbs. It asks you to determine a given verbs Modi, Tempora and Person.

This program was created by me around 2008 to help me in my greek lessons, it was one of my frist Python programs. Please bear in mind that the script is not 100% accurate, some forms are not correctly built/detected.

If you find a mistake please let me know and I will documente the errors!
I appreciate any feedback, but please understand that I can't give any advice on ancient greek - my greek lessons were a long time ago. ;)
